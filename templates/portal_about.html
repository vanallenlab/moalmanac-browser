            Molecular Oncology Almanac (MOAlmanac) is a clinical interpretation algorithm paired with an underlying
            knowledge base for precision oncology. The primary objective of MOAlmanac is to identify and associate
            molecular alterations with therapeutic sensitivity and resistance as well as disease prognosis. This is
            done for “first-order” genomic alterations -- individual events such as somatic variants, copy number
            alterations, fusions, and germline -- as well as “second-order” events -- those that are not associated
            with one single mutation, and may be descriptive of global processes in the tumor such as tumor mutational
            burden, microsatellite instability, mutational signatures, and whole-genome doubling.
            <br><br>
            The underlying database of this method is dependent on expert curation of the current body of knowledge on
            how molecular alterations affect clinical actionability. As the field of precision oncology grows, the
            quantity of research on how specific alterations affect therapeutic response and patient prognosis expands
            at an increasing rate. Curating the latest literature and presenting it in an accessible manner increases
            the abilities of clinicians and researchers alike to rapidly assess the importance of a molecular feature.
